# Prediction-Surface-Roughness-Machine-Learning

The use of Additive manufacturing (AM) or commonly known as 3D printing, has 
increased in recent years in various sectors such as, architecture, automotive, energy and 
healthcare. Fused filament fabrication (FFF) is one of the most widely used additive 
manufacturing. However, one of the main problems in Adaptive Manufature is surface 
roughness. The resulting surface roughness is greatly influenced by the molding process 
parameter settings.

This research aims to study the relationship between the parameters used in 3D printers 
and the surface roughness of the prints. The printing process on a 3D printer involves movement 
in the X, Y, and Z axes to form layers that generate vibrations. This research also includes the 
application of machine learning in predicting the quality level of printing results. The research 
was conducted by measuring the vibration level of the 3D printer machine and the surface 
roughness of the printed specimen using various parameter settings such as printing speed, 
extruder temperature and layer thickness.

The machine learning method used is polynomial regression to predict the quality level
of printing results. The accuracy of the R-squared machine learning system obtained in this study reached
85%. The results show that there is a correlation between layer thickness and vibration of the
3D printer machine and surface roughness of the print. With the application of machine
learning, the quality level of printing results can be predicted with sufficient accuracy. This
research has the potential to help improve the quality of printing results on 3D printer machines
by optimizing the parameter settings used.
